# Chinese Postman Problem 

This project provides a Python implementation for solving the **Chinese Postman Problem (CPP)**. The goal of CPP is to find the minimum-cost route that visits every edge in a given graph at least once, making it applicable to real-world scenarios such as postal delivery or garbage collection routes.

## Features
- **Graph Input**: Supports an undirected, weighted graph where edges can be added with their respective weights.
- **Odd-Degree Vertices Matching**: Automatically identifies vertices with odd degrees and finds the minimum-cost matching to make the graph Eulerian.
- **Eulerian Tour**: Constructs the Eulerian tour that visits every edge exactly once, even accounting for duplicate edges when necessary.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between vertices.
- **Cost Calculation**: Computes the total cost of traversing the graph, including the cost of additional edges required to make the graph Eulerian.

## How It Works
1. **Input Handling**: 
    - Number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`e`) are provided as input.
    - The edges are inputted with vertex connections and their weights.
    - A start vertex for the Eulerian tour is specified.

2. **Edge Addition**: 
    - If an edge between two vertices already exists but has a higher weight, the lower-weight edge replaces it.
    - If no such edge exists, the new edge is added to the graph and the adjacency list.

3. **Degree Calculation**: 
    - The degrees of all vertices are computed to identify vertices with odd degrees.

4. **Odd-Degree Vertices Matching**: 
    - Vertices with odd degrees are matched using a minimum-cost pairing, calculated using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm.

5. **Eulerian Tour Construction**: 
    - After ensuring the graph is Eulerian (i.e., no vertices with odd degrees), the algorithm constructs an Eulerian tour starting from the given vertex.

6. **Cost and Route Output**: 
    - The program outputs the total cost to traverse the graph and the route (sequence of edges) that forms the Eulerian tour.

## Code Explanation

### Key Functions

- `add_edge(edge_name, u, v, weight)`: 
    - Adds an edge between vertices `u` and `v` with the given weight. If an edge between these vertices already exists with a higher weight, it replaces the old one.

- `get_degrees(adjacency_list)`: 
    - Computes the degree (number of edges) for each vertex in the graph.

- `get_odd_degree_vertices(degree)`: 
    - Identifies vertices with odd degrees, which need to be paired to make the graph Eulerian.

- `dijkstra(source, target)`: 
    - Finds the shortest path between two vertices `source` and `target` using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns both the path and the distance.

- `find_minimum_matching(odd_vertices)`: 
    - Pairs the odd-degree vertices by finding the shortest paths between them.

- `add_minimum_matching_edges(odd_vertices, pairings)`: 
    - Adds the minimum-cost edges found during the matching process to ensure all vertices have even degrees.

- `find_eulerian_tour(start_vertex)`: 
    - Constructs the Eulerian tour from the starting vertex by traversing the graph.

- `solve_cpp()`: 
    - The main function that orchestrates the steps to solve the Chinese Postman Problem.
